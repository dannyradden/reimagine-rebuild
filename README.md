Denver Re:Imagine is a Recycling App that I am working on with Code for Denver.

As it was, Rails and React were being hosted on the same heroku server, but the React assets were not being served up  directly by Rails. This leads to quite a few complications, especially when it comes to routing. Rails was also bloated and leading to other problems. I decided to scrap Rails and SQL and replace it with Node and MongoDB. I used a small previous Node and React project as a boilerplate and then went from there. The final result is MUCH smoother, smaller, and does not have the same problems that Rails was having. I know the commit history is pretty terrible, please dont judge too harshly :D
